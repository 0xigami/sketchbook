[Sketchbook](https://sketchbook.wtf) is a place for artists to mint their sketches (works in progress) as free open editions on [Zora](https://zora.co), validate their concepts with collectors, and then raffle the completed pieces to those same collectors.

## Currently in Beta

At the moment, Sketchbook is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to test the concept with artists and collectors. So the entire experience isn't yet built into the site, but it will be soon. Also, we will be deploying the [Omega](https://omega.build) protocol, which powers the raffle component, on layer twos such as Zora Network, Base and Optimism.

Best part about making it available on these networks, is that due to differences in block times, and some other variances around MEV and the likes, we will no longer need to use [Chainlink VRF](https://chain.link/vrf) to get sufficient onchain randomness for the draws, like we do on mainnet. This means that the user experience will be much simpler, with very few steps.

This post describes how to use Sketchbook in its current MVP format, and for a limited time, Gami will be subsidising any $LINK and gas expenses relating to the raffles. This is very important, so that our early, curated cohort of artists don't have to worry about the technicalities and can simply focus on what they do best.

*If you're not an artist, feel free to skip the next section and go directly to an explanation of the Sketchbook business model.*

## Artist Tutorial

Start by opening the homepage in a new tab, while keeping this one open, then follow the steps below:

1. [Mint your sketch](https://zora.co/create/single-edition) (work in progress) as a free open edition on Zora, selecting Ethereum (mainnet) as your chosen network.
2. Make sure you are on the [Single Edition](https://zora.co/create/single-edition) page, not Multi-Edition (not yet supported), and follow the prompts to mint your sketch.
3. Set whatever parameters you like for the sale, such as making it a timed open edition, or giving it a limited supply, BUT make sure you set the price to 0 ETH. 
4. This is really important, so that collectors can mint your sketch for f\(r\)ee, and you will earn [zora protocol rewards](https://support.zora.co/en/articles/8192123-understanding-protocol-rewards-on-zora) of 0.000333 ETH per mint (currently 0.000444 ETH, but more on that later).
5.  Then once a few mints roll in, you'll get validation that there's demand for you to finish your piece. Once completed, mint your completed piece as a 1/1 or limited edition, on your platform of choice, making sure you're minting an [ERC721 NFT](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) on Ethereum (mainnet).
6.  Once the mint for your sketch is complete, either in time or quantity (based on your setup), you can either proceed to [omega.build](https://omega.build) to raffle your completed piece to sketch holders (will cost you some $LINK for onchain randomness and some ETH for gas), or send the NFT of your completed piece to `mvp.gami.eth`, and [Gami](https://gami.wtf) will take care of the rest.

In future, any steps that warrant Gami's involvement won't exist, and for full disclosure, Sketchbook has a business model that also depends on zora protocol rewards, just like your earnings from your f\(r\)ee open editions. 

## Business Model

Sketchbook, once in full production, will allow artists to mint, and collectors to collect, from [sketchbook.wtf](https://sketchbook.wtf) itself. This will qualify Sketchbook, which is a collaboration between [Gami](https://twitter.com/0xigami), [Iain Nash](https://twitter.com/isiain) and [Volky](https://twitter.com/volkyeth), for the Create and Mint referral portions of the zora protocol rewards.

**Here's how the split will look:**

1. Artist reward = 0.000333 ETH
2. First Minter reward = 0.000111 ETH
3. Sketchbook (create) referral = 0.000111 ETH
4. Sketchbook (mint) referral = 0.000111 ETH
5. Zora split = 0.000111 ETH

Currently, the First Minter reward is allocated to Artists, but soon that will be directed by Zora to whoever is the first person to mint each new sketch. This is intended as a kind of curator incentive. 

## Looking Ahead

In the near future, we are considering requesting funding from [Builder DAO](https://nouns.build/dao/ethereum/0xdf9b7d26c8fc806b1ae6273684556761ff02d422?tab=activity), or a similar funder of public goods, to complete the Sketchbook project and deploy it to Zora network, Base and Optimism. If successful, we're considering making the first mint automatic, to the treasury of our grant issuer (if successful), in order to share any revenues generated.

Our current understanding is that the First Minter reward, of 0.000111 ETH, is distributed for every successive mint. It helps to think of it like a Finder's Fee to whomever surfaced the NFT and minted it first. Depending on how we go with funding, the above mentioned revenue sharing may not apply. 

## Why Sketchbook?

If you're an artist, you've likely a sketchbook full of ideas and concepts itching to get out. But it's equally as likely that you experience a sense of apprehension, as you try to gauge whether or not people will vibe with the piece, when deciding whether to finish and release it.

So we're helping break down that barrier, by normalising the minting of everything, even your sketches, at a price point (basically free) that helps validate your ideas with collectors, onchain. So even if there's no interest, at least you've an onchain story unfolding, of your development as an artist.

Perhaps you're wondering why "Sketchbook" was chosen as the brand name? Well it's an obvious reference to an artist sketchbook, but "book" is also a subtle reference to bookmaking, as in setting odds. 

How many collectors mint your sketches, and the quantity they each mint, will essentially set the odds for all collectors' chances of winning the completed piece. 

## Feedback Welcome!

Sketchbook is actually the second project powered by the Omega protocol. [Forgeries](https://forgeries.wtf) was our first attempt at building on top of fair, transparent, and verifiably random onchain raffles. We've learned loads and applied our learnings to this pivot you're reading about now. 

So thanks for taking the time to read this introduction, and tutorial, and if you've any questions, please join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/2ZrssBNbp2) to discuss further with our team and the rest of the community.

Finally, we're kicking off the fun with a f\(r\)ee open edition, remixing the original "I drew it, really!" meme. During the mint, Gami will be doing his best to complete the famous sketch in his own style.
